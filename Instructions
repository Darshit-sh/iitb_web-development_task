### Instructions to Run the Room Allocation Application

#### Prerequisites

1. **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Required Libraries**: Install the required libraries using pip:
  
   pip install pandas

#### Setup and Execution

1. **Prepare the Script**

   Copy the entire script provided into a Python file, e.g., `room_allocation.py`.

2. **Run the Script**

   Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `room_allocation.py` is saved, and execute the script:

   python room_allocation.py

3. **Verify Output**

   The script will:
   - Create a `static` directory if it doesn't exist.
   - Generate `ginfo.csv` and `hinfo.csv` files in the `static` directory with the sample data.
   - Read these CSV files and process the data to allocate rooms based on group size and gender.
   - Print out the results, including:
     - **Allocated Rooms**: Details of rooms allocated to groups.
     - **Total Rooms**: The total number of rooms.
     - **Rooms Not Allocated**: Details of rooms that couldn't be allocated.

#### Detailed Steps

1. **File Preparation**

   The script initializes and saves CSV files with mock data for groups and hostels. This data includes:
   - **Groups**: Information about group IDs, number of members, and gender details.
   - **Hostels**: Information about hostel names, room numbers, capacities, and gender specifications.

2. **Data Reading**

   - **Groups Data**: The script reads `ginfo.csv` and processes the gender field to handle both simple and compound gender specifications.
   - **Hostels Data**: The script reads `hinfo.csv` to get details about each hostel room.

3. **Allocation Logic**

   - **Allocation Function**: This function matches groups with hostel rooms based on capacity and gender. It ensures no room is double-allocated and handles gender-specific reservations.
   - **Results**: After allocation, it prints which rooms have been allocated, the total number of rooms, and any rooms that could not be allocated.

4. **Output**

   - **Allocated Rooms**: Displays rooms successfully allocated to groups.
   - **Total Rooms**: Shows the total number of rooms available.
   - **Rooms Not Allocated**: Lists rooms that couldnâ€™t be assigned to any group due to mismatches in capacity or gender.

#### Troubleshooting

- **File Not Found Error**: Ensure that the script is executed in the directory where the `static` folder is created.
- **Dependency Issues**: Make sure `pandas` and other dependencies are properly installed. Reinstall them if necessary.
- **Data Accuracy**: Verify that the data in `ginfo.csv` and `hinfo.csv` is correctly formatted and corresponds to the expected structure.

Feel free to modify the script or data according to your needs. If you encounter any specific issues or need further customization, additional debugging may be required.
